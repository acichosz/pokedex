# Pokedex

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## App description

The 'Pokedex' application dispalys a list of Pokemons. After clicking on selected Pokemon, the modal with details and similar Pokemons is displayed. Access to Pokemon's details is also possible by application URL address with Pokemon's ID (pokedex/pop9-17).

## Remarks

Logical operators don't work with HP filter (http requests), so there were set only hp min filter, types and rarity to get similar Pokemons. Hp max filer was included by filtering received response.
